## Introduction

> There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one  order of magnitude improvement in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.

* Innovations in the software can yield an "order-of-magnitude" improvement
* Example given in medicine where doctors where taught the benefits of cleanliness improving health of patients
  * In the same way improving processes in software can help improve software step by step

## Does It Have To Be Hard

* Software can't hope to see the gains that hardware has seen with improved chip design every 2 years.

1. Software construction really can't be compared with hardware constructions.
  1. Hardware advances in the last 30 years cannot be compared to any other technology
2. Difficulties in Software:
> I believe the hard part of building software to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation.

  1. Syntax errors in software pale in comparison to conceptual errors in a system
  2. There is no silver bullet

#### Complexity

* Computers themselves are among the most complicated things humans build
* Software Construction is more than merely putting parts together
  * Elements of a software system interact in nonlinear ways
* Example given in mathematics where advances in math came for 3 straight centuries because of simplified models
* Complexities in Software Construction create the following issues:
  * Communication among team members
    * In turn produces product flaws, cost overruns, schedule delays
  * Complexity in understanding all possible states of a system and enumerating the states of a system
    * This drives unreliability
  * Complexity thereby make programs hard to use
  * Complexity makes programs harder to extend newer functionality and consequently introducing side effects
  * Complexity also makes security of a software system more difficult to understand
  * Complexity also makes management more difficult

#### Conformity

* Software engineers face added complexity because they must conform to decisions made by others
* Conforming to other software components itself makes software systems more complex

#### Changeability

* Since software is much more malleable and easier to change this by itself introduces more challenges
* Users of a software system find new uses for software and thereby introduce new complexities
* A combination of users of a software system, laws introduced, and new software machinery add difficulties as well

#### Invisibility

* Software is inherently invisible and hard to visualize if even possible
* Attempts to visualize a system become difficult because of all the working pieces
* Since software cannot be easily visualized this in turn adds more complexity to systems

## Past Breakthroughs Solved Accidental Difficulties

The 3 Steps in software that have helped accidental difficulties:

1. High-level Languages
2. Time-sharing
3. Unified programming environments

#### High-level languages

High-level languages helps in the following ways:

* Alleviates accidental complexity
* Diminish complexities that arose from programming in assembly language and understanding machine code
* Improve processes by the use of higher level concepts such as data structures and data types

#### Time-sharing

* Reduced compilation and execution times of software systems help keep program logic in context
  * This is true because a shorter feedback loop helps engineers keep focused on the task at hand

#### Unified programming environments

* Development of Unix and Interlisp helped with using software programs together and improving productivity
* Unified file formats, and integrated libraries helped immeasurably as well

## Hopes for the Silver

**Looking at possible silve bullets**

#### Ada and other high-level language advances

* Ada is touted as a very influential programming language
* Ada's philosophy more than its features as a language have been influential
* Fred Brooks makes a prediction that Ada will have an impact by training engineers with modern software practices

### Object-oriented programming

* Argues that object-oriented programming (OOP) helps remove boilerplate of previous software constructs
* OOP helps with higher-order design of software systems
* Argues that OOP can only help if some of the troubles of `type specification` is reduced in systems

#### Artificial intelligence

Brooks examines argument made by `Parnas` on AI

1. The use of computers to solve problems that previously could only be solved by applying human intelligence.
  1. Argument is made that what people consider is AI today can rapidly change, kind of like a floating goal.
2. The use of a specific set of programming techniques knows as heuristic or rule-based programming.
  1. Not detail expounded on rule based systems but I can surmise that there are unspoken challenges since this requires expert knowledge that must be gleaned from an actual expert

#### Expert systems

* Inference engines offer advantages over deterministic logic through application independence and varied use
* Rule sets can encode universal ideas that can be applied to different applications thereby distributing complexity
* Argues that separation of application complexity from the software program itself is an important advance

Applications for software tasks:

* Suggest interface rules
* Help with testing strategies
* Optimization strategies

#### Automatic programming

#### Graphical Programming

#### Program verification

#### Environments and tools

#### Workstations

## Promising Attacks on the Conceptual Essence

#### Buy versus build

#### Requirements refinement and rapid prototyping

#### Incremental development grow not build software

#### Great designers
