# List of Questions for Fred Brooks
Accidental Difficulties:

1. Complexity
2. Conformity
3. Changeability
4. Invisibility


1. Would you consider the rise of functional programming concepts to help with accidental difficulties?

2. `Ada` is mentioned in the No Silver Bullet as a language training programmers in modern software design techniques.

Are their languages now that you think have been even more influential than Ada?

3. I am curious what you meant with the statement:
"An order-of-magnitude gain can be made by object-oriented programming only if the unnecessary underbrush of type specification remaining today in our programming language is itself responsible for nine-tenths of the work involved in designing a program product. I doubt it."

4. Do you think advances in Virtual Reality technologies could help visualize software systems better?

5. Have you seen any advances in Database Systems that have suprised you?

6. In No Silver Bullet you mention:
"I   believe   the   single   most   powerful   software   productivity   strategy   for   man   organizations to day is to equip the computer-na√Øve intellectual workers on the firing line with  personal  computers  and  good  generalized  writing,  drawing,  file  and  spreadsheet  programs,   and   turn   them   loose. "

What are your thoughts on introducing Computer Science curriculums to K to 12 and teaching computer science as England is now doing?

Do you think this holds great promise for the future for any countries who also adopt this practice?

7. What advances in Artificial Intelligence do you think are still necessary?
Can machine learning help design expert systems in particular knowledge acquisation?

8. Do you think advances in Automation in particular Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment have helped in building software?

9. Is there any other areas in Software that you believe have helped with accidental difficulties?
